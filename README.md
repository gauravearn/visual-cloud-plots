# visual-cloud-plots
A command line utility coded to incorporate all types of the plots for the single cell analysis plus incoporated some new ones. This will be updated regularly. Specifically coding for the visualization of multiple plots and integrating them in all one. Additionally, if you use this code, then modify the parameters according to your needs. Each types of bilayer to multi layer plots which can be passed directly from the single cell expression analysis. After finishing all of the additions, I will add the shiny visualization also.
